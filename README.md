# eof_trend_analysis

Open source code for paper "Estimating temperature trends with EOF analysis and application to polar regions"

This code is for plotting area normalized Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF's), which are ideal for the purpose of trend analysis. The code can also be used to calculate the statistical likelihood (p value) of the trend under the consideration of a linear trend plus noise (described by an ARFIMA(1,d,0) model). The code is written entirely in python, and makes much use of the eofs and cartopy packages.

If the code is helpful for research then please consider citing the paper "Estimating temperature trends with EOF analysis and application to polar regions", Ewan T. Phillips, Holger Kantz, 2024.
